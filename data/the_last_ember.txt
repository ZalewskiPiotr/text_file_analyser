Title: The Last Ember

In the twilight-shadowed realm of Eldwyn, where dragons once soared and stars whispered secrets to the moon, there lived a boy named Kael. He was a blacksmith’s apprentice, ordinary in every way—except for the ember he carried in a silver locket around his neck.

The ember, warm to the touch, was the last remnant of the Flameheart, a mythical fire said to awaken the ancient guardians of the realm. Most believed it was only legend, but Kael’s mother, before vanishing into the Mistwood, told him otherwise.

One storm-churned evening, darkness spread unnaturally across the skies. Creatures from forgotten ages crept from the cracks of the world. Villagers fled, but Kael stood firm. Guided by an old raven and the flicker of the ember, he journeyed to the peak of Mount Virell.

There, among ruins older than time, Kael cast the ember into a stone brazier. Flames roared to life, golden and wild. From the fire rose the guardians—phoenixes, lions of stone, and trees that walked.

The darkness receded.

Kael, no longer ordinary, became the Keeper of Flame—a legend in his own right.
